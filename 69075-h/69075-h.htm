    <div class="verse indent0">Said the Fairy Ink-Bottle Babies, “What do you think?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We all came out of a bottle of ink!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are very little to mind each rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But still we are going to start to school;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if we remember, it starts in September!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This old-fashioned thing called school!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said the Fairy Ink-Bottle Babies, “What fun!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See, school has already begun!”</div>

</div>

<p>The Fairy Ink-Bottle Babies sat in a row. They
looked as though they would roll off the top of the
desks at any minute.</p>

<p>“You are almost as bad about rolling over as
the Roly-Poly children,” said the teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried one of the Ink-Bottle Babies.
“I am rolling over!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, thump! bump! thump! she went.
She fell off the desk to the floor, leaving the marks
of her little black feet behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried all the Ink-Bottle Babies together,
“somebody pick her up! Somebody pick
her up!”</p>

<p>The teacher was so scared that she went out of
the room.</p>

<p>Pretty soon all the children went home. What
do you suppose happened next?</p>

<p>The Fairy Ink-Bottle Mamma came
down from the window sill and picked
up her baby!</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp46" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus02.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>Picked up her baby</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>She said, “You are too
little to go to school; you
had better come with me.”</p>

<p>Then the other Ink-Bottle
Babies set up a cry,
“May we come, too, Ma?
May we come, too?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma
said, “Creep down quietly
from the desks and you may
all come.”</p>

<p>Then all the Ink-Bottle Babies crept down and
followed their Mamma out of the door. They
walked a little way until they came to their home
in the woods.</p>

<p>“I am so sleepy,” said the first Ink-Bottle
Baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“I am so sleepy,” said the second Ink-Bottle
Baby.</p>

<p>Then all but one of the twenty-five Ink-Bottle
Babies said, “I am so sleepy!”</p>

<p>One Ink-Bottle Baby said, “I am not sleepy at
all. I rolled off the desk and I feel wide-awake!”</p>

<p>This little Baby’s name was Molly. The Ink-Bottle
Mamma put all of her babies to bed except
Molly, and Molly said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am wide-awake as if it were day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll sit on the parlor rug and play.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma was so sleepy herself
that she did not know what to do. Pretty soon
she said, “Listen, Molly, and I will tell you a
fairy tale.”</p>

<p>Then Molly cried, “I must wake Polly up to
hear the fairy tale.” Polly was Molly’s twin
sister.</p>

<p>Will you believe it? Before the Ink-Bottle
Mamma could say “No!” Molly had gone upstairs
and had waked all the Babies up before she
found Polly!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies looked so much alike it
was hard to tell them apart!</p>

<p>All the Ink-Bottle Babies woke up and cried,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
“We want to hear the fairy tale, Ma! Please
tell us all a fairy tale!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “Get back
into bed, every one of you, and I will tell you a
story.”</p>

<p>Then the Babies all crept back into bed and their
Mamma told them the story of the Magic Pitcher.</p>

<p>Here is the story she told:</p>

<p>Once there was a little dwarf who lived alone in
the woods. He lived in a little blue house with
a red chimney. He was very proud of his red chimney.
He painted the chimney every spring.</p>

<p>The little dwarf was very good-natured except
when he started to cook. He could not cook a
decent meal to save his life. He went about all
day humming a little song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can live without clothing and live without books,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But how is a fellow to live without cooks?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One day as he passed by a little brook he sang
this song, and the brook said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you take the pebbles from out this brook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will try to help you find a cook!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Then the little dwarf stooped down and began
to pick the pebbles out of the brook.</p>

<p>At last, only one large stone remained. He
pulled and tugged with all his might, and at last
the brook ran merrily along, for he got the big
stone up on the bank.</p>

<p>The brook sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look again, now I am free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The magic pitcher you will see!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf looked down into the brook,
and sure enough, there was a magic pitcher all
blue and gold. The water ran deeper now, in the
little brook, so the little dwarf had to
dive down after the pitcher.</p>

<p>He came out choking and sputtering,
but he had the magic pitcher in his hand.
Then he ran homeward singing
and whistling all the
way. He sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I can live without clothing and live without books,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But how is a fellow to live without cooks?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp60" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>He poured once more</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>He got some bread and cheese out of a cupboard
and drew the pitcher full of water, and sat down
to his lonely meal.</p>

<p>He started to pour out a glass of water, and as
he poured it from the magic pitcher, it turned into
fine, rich milk. He poured once more, and this time
it was honey that came out of the magic pitcher.</p>

<p>He tried again and out came tea! So it went
on. Every time he poured from the magic pitcher,
out came something delicious to drink.</p>

<p>The little dwarf grew so happy and healthy that
when he went into the woods to chop down trees
he could chop six trees while the other little
dwarfs could only chop down one.</p>

<p>He never sang any more about wanting a cook,
and he seemed so happy that the other little dwarfs
were jealous of him, and they said, “We will find
out his secret.”</p>

<p>So, one evening when it was late, they all crept
to the house where the little dwarf lived, and they
all peeped in at the window.</p>

<p>There sat the little dwarf by the table pouring
from his magic pitcher. He poured out coffee, and
cream, and molasses!</p>

<p>My! the other little dwarfs turned green with
envy. They said, “We will have that pitcher.”</p>

<p>They opened the door, ran into the house, seized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the pitcher, and ran away, away, away, into the
deep woods.</p>

<p>The little dwarf was so sad, he went to the brook
again and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The dwarfs have carried my pitcher away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! alackaday!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I will fix them,” said the little brook. “You
were so good to take all my stones away, you shall
soon have the pitcher back again; never fear.”</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf went back home singing a
merry song.</p>

<p>Now the dwarfs had carried the pitcher away
with them, and when they had run for a long time,
they saw a little brook, winding in and out among
the trees, and they said, “We will fill the pitcher
with water.”</p>

<p>So the first little dwarf ran and filled the pitcher
with water. Then he ran back to his companions
who sat in a circle, and began to fill their glasses.
They all set up a shout, for out of the pitcher came
only thick mud!</p>

<p>“You have played a trick on us,” they cried.</p>

<p>Then the second little dwarf went and filled the
pitcher.</p>

<p>“It is pure water,” he said, but when he went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to pour from the pitcher, lo! and behold! out came
vinegar!</p>

<p>Then the third little dwarf said, “Let me try,”
and the next said, “Let me try,” but each time
there came out of the pitcher something quite unfit
to drink.</p>

<p>Then the dwarfs said, “This pitcher is of no
account after all; we will throw it into the brook.”</p>

<p>They said, “If the little dwarf finds it again,
he is welcome to drink all the mud and vinegar
he wants.”</p>

<p>Then they threw the pitcher back into the brook,
and the brook carried it safely back to the place
in the woods where the little dwarf passed every
day. Pretty soon the little dwarf came along. He
sang,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>He filled the pitcher with water and soon poured
out a fine drink of buttermilk.</p>

<p>He ran home as fast as his legs could carry him,
and he hid his pitcher safely away.</p>

<p>He worked at home very busily all that day.
He made shades for his window, so no one could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
look in. He put a lock on his door, and he made
a little key to fit the lock.</p>

<p>“Now, no one can see what I pour from my
pitcher,” he said, “and no one can come in, unless
I invite him.”</p>

<p>He went to bed and slept well. Late that night
a most remarkable thing happened. Five and
twenty little men came to his door and they rapped
and they tapped, and he would not let them in!</p>

<p>Then they laid down five and twenty little parcels
on his doorstep and they crept away. Next
morning the little dwarf went to his door and saw
the five and twenty little parcels. They were all
from the grocery store.</p>

<p>On each parcel was written, “Compliments from
the little dwarfs, with thanks for the borrowed
pitcher.”</p>

<p>On one package was written, “Don’t drink too
much mud and vinegar!”</p>

<p>The little dwarf went to the brook and asked
what all this meant. When the brook told him
he laughed until he cried.</p>

<p>The little dwarf may still live in the woods, for
all I know, and he may still be drinking out of
his magic pitcher.</p>

<p>As soon as the Ink-Bottle Mamma stopped talking
all her Babies went to sleep.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies woke up cross. Every one
of them got up out of the wrong side of the bed!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma called, “Hurry, hurry,
or you will all be late to school!”</p>

<p>Then Molly called, “I can’t find my shoes,”
and Polly called, “I can’t find my dress,” and all
the Ink-Bottle Babies set up such a wail that the
Ink-Bottle Mamma had to come upstairs and help
them dress.</p>

<p>She said, “My dear children, will you never
grow up?”</p>

</div>

<p>When they sat down at the table, Molly said, “I
don’t want this oatmeal,” and Polly said, “I don’t
want any either.”</p>

<p>Then all the Ink-Bottle Babies said, “We don’t
want any oatmeal!”</p>

<p>They laid down their twenty-five little spoons.
And will you believe it? Not one of the Babies
would eat any breakfast!</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “Get down
from your chairs, every one of you.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies got down from their chairs,
pouting and scolding. Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma
put on their caps and sent them right off to school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“Hurry! hurry!” she said. “Don’t be late for
school!”</p>

<p>They had not gone far when the first Ink-Bottle
Baby said, “I will not go another step!”</p>

<p>Then the second Ink-Bottle Baby said, “I will
not go another step!”</p>

<p>Then what do you suppose happened next? They
all sat down in a row and they cried and they
screamed and they howled!</p>

<p>Just then an old farmer came along with his
wagon.</p>

<p>When he saw all the Ink-Bottle Babies in a row,
he said, “Bless my heart! What funny little babies!
What are you all doing here?”</p>

<p>Then Molly and Polly cried, “Give us a ride,
please! We don’t care which way we go!”</p>

<p>Then the farmer got down and helped all the
Babies into his wagon and they rode merrily
away!</p>

<p>They laughed and talked and said, “Oh!” and
“Ah!” and “What a fine ride!”</p>

<p>When they rode by the school they kept very
still, and they all crept down in the bottom of
the wagon.</p>

<p>On and on they rode, through the woods and
into a town and away off to a little red house on
a farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Will you spend the day with me?” asked the
farmer.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “We will! We
will!” And they jumped up and down with joy.
They had a fine time all day. They saw the sheep
and pigs and cows, and they took turns riding
on a little pony.</p>

<p>When night came Molly and Polly cried, “We
want our Ma! We want our Ma!”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife was very deaf, but she saw
that all the Ink-Bottle Babies were crying at once,
so she gave each one a cookie. The cookies had
red sugar on them. They had raisins in them.
The Ink-Bottle Babies cried and would not eat
their cookies.</p>

<p>Then the farmer’s wife took Polly on the right
arm of her chair, and she took Molly on the left
arm of her chair. Then she let all the rest of the
Ink-Bottle Babies crowd around her.</p>

<p>Next, the farmer’s wife put on her spectacles
and opened a great red book. Then all the Ink-Bottle
Babies clapped their hands and set up a
shout, for they could see the name of the book.</p>

<p>It was called “Tip-Top Fairy Tales.”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife smiled at the Babies and
began to read slowly. She skipped the hard words
and stumbled over the easy ones!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>If you do not like to listen to her read, you will
have to read for yourself the story of Goldy and
Brownie, or The Fortune Teller. Here is the story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there were two sisters. They
were as different as they could be.</p>

<p>Goldy was good and beautiful. Brownie was ugly
and cross.</p>

<p>One day Goldy said, “I am going down into the
valley to see the Fortune Teller. I am going to
have my fortune told.”</p>

<p>Brownie said, “You shall not go. I am afraid
you will have a better fortune than mine if you
go first.”</p>

<p>Then Brownie tied Goldy into a chair and she
went out of the house and locked the door.</p>

<p>Brownie said, “I will have my fortune told
first.”</p>

<p>She went into the valley where an old Gypsy
lived. She knocked at the door and the Gypsy
called out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Cross-Patch, pull the latch,</div>

  </div>
</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>She stamped her foot</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Brownie was a little afraid to pull the latch at
first, but as the Gypsy did not speak again she
knew she must do something, so she pulled the
latch. The door opened, and she went into the
house.</p>

<p>She said, “You cross old woman, I want my
fortune told.”</p>

<p>The Gypsy looked at her and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may bake and brew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But whatever you do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll uglier grow each day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But make a wish, just make one wish,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make a wish and go away!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Brownie was so angry she stamped her foot and
said the first thing that came into her mind.</p>

<p>She said, “I wish I had a fine fur coat to wear
all the time.”</p>

<p>Then the Gypsy touched her with her cane, and
her dress turned into a fur coat, and Brownie herself
turned into a caterpillar!</p>

<p>“There!” said the Gypsy, “I guess you have a
fur coat to wear all the time.”</p>

<p>The Gypsy forgot one thing. She forgot to take
away Brownie’s voice, so she could talk as well as
ever.</p>

<p>Brownie went crawling slowly home. She called
out to Goldy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go to the Gypsy, whatever you do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A very fine fortune waits there for you!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She really hoped that the Gypsy would turn
her sister into a caterpillar, too!</p>

<p>Then Brownie sighed, for she remembered that
she had tied Goldy into her chair, and that she
could not get away if she wanted to.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a prince came by and Brownie cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The beautiful princess sits in a chair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just take a peep in the window there!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>The prince was so surprised to hear a voice and
see no one, that he cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What shall I do? What shall I do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll peep through the window to see if it’s true.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he tiptoed to the window so softly his feet
never made a sound, and sure enough, there he
saw Goldy sitting in the chair—tied in, fast asleep.</p>

<p>The prince tried to get into the house. He tried
the front door, and the back door, and the side
door, and all the windows. At last he found a
window that would open. He sat on the window
sill and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Golden Hair, will you come to me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May I come in and set you free?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Goldy woke up. She had read about
princes, but she had never seen one before. She
was so surprised she only nodded her head.</p>

<p>Then the prince came in and cut the cords that
bound her.</p>

<p>Goldy said, “Thank you!” Then she went and
made the prince a cup of tea.</p>

<p>They were about to sit down and enjoy the tea
when a dove flew in at the window. It had a message<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
tied round its neck. The message was for the
prince. It said, “Come home at once. Your father
is ill.”</p>

<p>So the prince took off his cap with the big
feather in it, and made a bow. Then he went out
of the window as suddenly as he had come.</p>

<p>Goldy said to herself, “I will go to the Gypsy
and have my fortune told. Perhaps I shall meet
the prince again.”</p>

<p>So she put on her blue dress and sunbonnet,
and went to the house where the Gypsy lived, and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>The Gypsy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cross-Patch, pull the latch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit by the fire and spin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cross-Patch, pull the latch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open the door, come in!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Goldy opened the door and walked in.</p>

<p>“Will you tell my fortune?” she said.</p>

<p>The Gypsy liked Goldy, but to save her life she
did not know how to tell a very good fortune, so
she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whatever you do your wish will come true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So make it, I pray, and go quickly away!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Goldy was wishing in her heart that she could
see the prince, so she said at once, “I wish I
could fly.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus06.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>She knocked at the door</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the Gypsy touched her with her cane and
her blue dress turned into a shining
pair of wings. She became a beautiful
blue butterfly, and sailed away
and away in the sunshine. By and
by she sailed into the king’s garden.</p>

<p>The prince came out and cried,
“Oh what a beautiful butterfly.”</p>

<p>Then Goldy told him what had
happened and she said, “Go to the
Gypsy and see how I can be
changed back again.”</p>

<p>Then the prince went in a
hurry to the Gypsy, you may
believe. When the Gypsy
heard him knock she cried as
before,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cross-Patch, pull the latch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit by the fire and spin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cross-Patch, pull the latch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open the door, come in!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The prince opened the door and made his very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
best bow and said, “I wish Goldy were changed
back into a beautiful girl and standing here beside
me.”</p>

<p>The Gypsy nodded her head and soon a blue
butterfly came floating in through the window. The
Gypsy said a magic verse, and changed the butterfly
back into the girl Goldy.</p>

<p>Then Goldy and the prince thanked the Gypsy.
They were married at once, and they went to live
in the king’s palace. They were not so happy
as they had expected to be for Goldy cried all
day, “I miss my sister Brownie. Go and find
my ugly little sister.”</p>

<p>The prince went out to look for Brownie. He
traveled high and low but he could not find her.</p>

<p>Then Goldy went out to look for her sister. She
went to her old home and she heard a voice say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am as lonely as can be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sister Goldy, come to me!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Goldy cried, “Here I am. Where are you
hiding, little sister?”</p>

<p>Then Brownie told about her being changed into
an ugly caterpillar, and they went together to the
Gypsy.</p>

<p>The Gypsy was sitting on her doorstep and Goldy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
cried out, “See, I will give you this golden dish
if you will change the caterpillar into my little sister.”</p>

<p>The Gypsy liked the dish and she said a few
magic words and changed the caterpillar into the
girl Brownie.</p>

<p>Brownie was now so happy that she was good-looking.
Many a young prince came and fell
in love with her but Brownie was so happy to
live with her sister and the prince, that she sang
a very merry song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have lovers four and twenty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One or two would be a plenty;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Since the old Gypsy set me free.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One day there came to the palace a little lame
prince. He was as ugly as a barb-wire fence, but
Brownie let him in. She gave him a cup of tea
and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>The little lame prince said, “I am ugly and no
one loves me. Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>Brownie said, “I will marry you.” And they
were married in the rose garden, and they grew
better looking and happier every day.</p>

<p>Whenever they saw sick caterpillars or butterflies
with broken wings, they took care of them.</p>

<p>Brownie and Goldy each had a home near the
king’s palace, and they were happy all their lives.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Is that all? Tell
it again! Tell it again! Please do! Read it or
tell it! It is a lovely story!”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife said, “It must be bedtime.”
They looked at the great clock that stood in the
hall, and the clock said it was ten o’clock!</p>

<p>“I am going home to-morrow, and I am going
to school,” said Molly.</p>

<p>“I, too,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“We, too,” cried all the Ink-Bottle Babies. “We
are all going to learn to read that story.”</p>

<p>Then they scampered upstairs and went to bed.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to go to sleep, Molly
said, “It is awful to have to spell out the words
like the farmer’s wife does.”</p>

<p>Polly said, “I am going to learn to read!”</p>

<p>The day before Thanksgiving Molly began to
cry on the way home from school. Then Polly
began to cry! Pretty soon all the Ink-Bottle Babies
took out their twenty-five little pocket handkerchiefs
and began to cry!</p>

<p>When they got home Mamma said, “Why do
you cry?”</p>

<p>The first Ink-Bottle Baby said, “I don’t know,
boo-hoo!”</p>

<p>The second Ink-Bottle Baby said, “I don’t know,
boo-hoo!”</p>

<p>Polly said, “I am crying because Molly is
crying.”</p>

<p>Molly said, “I am crying because we have no
grandma and grandpa to go to see on Thanksgiving
Day.”</p>

<p>Then all the Ink-Bottle Babies said, “We want
a grandma and grandpa, boo-hoo!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “Dry your eyes,
and I will tell you what to do.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies dried their eyes
and Mamma said, “Suppose we go and spend
Thanksgiving Day with the farmer and his wife!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies clapped their hands and
shouted, “Hurrah! hurrah!”</p>

<p>When they had stopped their noise, Mamma
said each Baby should take a pie in a little basket
to the farmer and his wife.</p>

<p>Then she took the Babies to the pantry and
showed them twenty-five little pies all in a row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies were so anxious to start
that they said, “To-morrow will never come!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma knew a few things to
make the time pass, so she said, “Who will
sweep my floor? Who will dust my chairs? Who
will wipe my dishes?”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies all set to work at
once, and they swept the floor and dusted the
furniture, and they wiped the dishes, and soon
the work was all done.</p>

<p>At bedtime the Babies said, “Three cheers for
the farm. Hurrah for the farmer and his wife!
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!”</p>

<p>Then they all went to bed and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Early next morning the Ink-Bottle Babies were
all ready to start. Each one carried a basket. The
Ink-Bottle Mamma locked the house and put the
key under the doormat. Then they were all ready
to go.</p>

<p>They walked a long way, and were getting quite
tired, when a man came along in his automobile.</p>

<p>He said, “You cunning little Babies, where are
you going?”</p>

<p>Then the Babies shouted, “We are going to
the farm. We are going to see the farmer and
his wife, and we are taking them some pumpkin
pies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The man said, “I will take you to the farm
if you will give me one or two of your pies!”</p>

<p>He said, “I have not tasted a pumpkin pie for
forty years!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies wept to think of a man
not tasting a pie for so many years, and they
all crowded around the automobile and cried,
“Take mine! Please take mine!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma stepped up and
said, “Please Sir, we need all these pies to-day,
but if you care to give us a ride and then will
call at my house to-morrow you may have all
the pies you can carry.”</p>

<p>The man was delighted, you may be sure. He
helped the Ink-Bottle Mamma right into the automobile
and called to the Babies, “Pile in, one and
all!”</p>

<p>Soon they were all riding merrily along the
road.</p>

<p>The man allowed Polly and Molly to blow the
horn and they rode right into the farmer’s yard
and right up to his front door.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife came out and cried, “Bless
my soul! What a fine automobile! And bless my
soul! Here are the Ink-Bottle Babies again!”</p>

<p>Then the farmer heard the noise and came out
and said, “Bless my buttons! Let me count the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Babies! Yes, they are here, every last one of
them!”</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the Ink-Bottle Mamma,
and he bowed to her politely and helped her out.</p>

<p>The man who owned the automobile looked at
the farmer and said, “Will you have a ride, good
people?”</p>

<p>Now the farmer and his wife had never ridden
in an automobile in their lives.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “Go right along;
don’t mind us; we will get the dinner!”</p>

<p>The farmer said, “Wait till I get some turkeys
and ducks ready for dinner,” and the farmer’s
wife said, “Wait till I make a few dozen pies!”</p>

<p>At the word “pies,” the Ink-Bottle Babies set
up a shout, and each one made a low bow and
presented the farmer’s wife with a little pie. She
was so surprised that she hardly knew what to
say.</p>

<p>The farmer called, “Put on your old gray bonnet!”
Then the Babies began to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Put on your old gray bonnet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the blue ribbons on it!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the stranger said, “You are very sweet
singers!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Soon the farmer and his wife were ready, and
they went whizzing away in the automobile. Then
the Ink-Bottle Mamma began to cook the turkeys
and many other things, and the Ink-Bottle Babies
had the table all set by the time the farmer and
his wife returned.</p>

<p>Did they have a big dinner? Well, I guess they
did. They had turkey and duck, and sweet-potatoes
and white potatoes, and squash, and carrots,
and rice, and jelly, and pickles, and pudding, and
cranberry sauce, and cake, and ice cream, and
pumpkin pies!</p>

<p>The farmer and his wife said, “We never had
such a happy Thanksgiving before!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Hurrah for the
turkey! Hurrah for the pumpkin
pies!”</p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Presented the farmer’s wife with a little pie</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>After dinner the Babies begged for
a story. They said,
“Read us a fairy tale;
please read us a fairy
tale!”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife
said, “I have broken
my glasses and I cannot
see to read, but Pa
will tell you a story!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Then the farmer grew quite red in the face and
said, “I don’t know any fairy stories; honestly I
don’t!”</p>

<p>“You know about the fox and the crow,” said
the farmer’s wife.</p>

<p>Then the Babies climbed up on his chair and
on his knees and there was no way out of it; he
had to begin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There once was a crow, and at early morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spied the farmer’s field of corn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, ‘As sure as I am born,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll have that corn, heigh-o!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” shouted all the Babies. “Tell
about the fox. Please tell us some more.” Then
the farmer said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There once was a fox so very sly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knew that farmer’s field hard by;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘To catch the crow, I’m going to try,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said the fox with a soft heigh-o!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the farmer stopped. The Babies begged
him to go on but he said, “Honestly that is all
I know.”</p>

<p>“Did the crow get the corn?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“Did the fox get the crow?” asked Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the farmer. “How can
I tell about such things? I only went to school
one year in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Ink-Bottle Babies, “we intend
to go to school for seventeen years!”</p>

<p>“That is right,” said the farmer; “then you
will learn all about the fox and the crow.”</p>

<p>Just at this minute, the farmer’s wife set up
a cry. “Oh see the cunning little baskets! See
the twenty-five little baskets! We must not send
them home empty!”</p>

<p>Then she whispered something in Molly’s ear,
and she whispered something in Polly’s ear, and
each Ink-Bottle Baby whispered to the next one.</p>

<p>Then they carried their twenty-five little baskets
with them and they all scampered down to the
cellar. The farmer’s wife went with them and
showed them five barrels of apples.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife said, “Help yourselves. Fill
your baskets full.”</p>

<p>What fun they had, picking apples first out of
one barrel and then out of another!</p>

<p>They were all ready to start home at last,
when the farmer said, “Where are the apples
for the Ink-Bottle Mamma?”</p>

<p>Then the farmer’s wife gave her a bag of apples
and a bag of nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The farmer hitched up his horses to the wagon,
and the Ink-Bottle Mamma and the Ink-Bottle
Babies all piled in.</p>

<p>“Crack!” went the whip, and they were off
and away singing and whistling as they went.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said to the farmer, “It
is very kind in you to take us home in your
wagon!”</p>

<p>The farmer said, “I never had twenty-five
grandchildren, and I love every one of your
babies.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies began to get sleepy.
They tried to remember the story the farmer had
told and they said,</p>

<p>“There once was a fox at early morn.”</p>

<p>“No! That is not right!” said Molly.</p>

<p>Then they tried it again, and they said, “There
once was a farmer’s field of corn.”</p>

<p>“No! no!” shouted Polly, “that is not right.”</p>

<p>The farmer had to tell the story again, and
the Babies repeated it after him in a singsong
way:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>It was December and Christmas was coming.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies said, “May we hang up
our stockings now? May we hang all our stockings
in a row?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies all talked at once. They
made such a noise that the postman had to rap
five times before he could be heard.</p>

<p>Then Molly said, “Hush! Listen! I hear a
knock!”</p>

<p>Polly went dancing to the door and came back
with a letter in her hand. The letter was addressed
to the Ink-Bottle Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>She opened it and said, “The farmer and his
wife want us to go and spend Christmas day with
them! They say, ‘Tell the Babies to bring their
stockings.’”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies were glad, you may be
sure.</p>

<p>They clapped their hands and shouted, “May
we go, Ma? Say yes, Ma. Please let us go!”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “We will go with
pleasure.”</p>

<p>The days passed very fast after that, and it was
almost Christmas time; and all would have gone
well, I am sure, but two days before Christmas
Molly was taken sick, and Polly said, “I don’t
feel well either.”</p>

<p>Then what do you suppose happened? All the
Ink-Bottle Babies came down with the measles.</p>

<p>They cried and they howled, “We can’t go
away on Christmas Day! Oh dear! Oh
dear!”</p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>I don’t feel well either</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>When they had
stopped their noise
the Ink-Bottle Mamma
said, “Never
mind, Santa Claus
will not forget you.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Babies dried their eyes. They began to think
about Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Toward evening a package was left at the
door. It said, “For the measley Babies from the
farmer’s wife.”</p>

<p>When the Ink-Bottle Mamma brought the parcel
upstairs the Babies cried, “Untie it quickly;
please do, and let us all see what is inside!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma untied the parcel,
and took out a big red book! The book was
called “Tip-Top Fairy Tales.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies were so happy they forgot
all about the measles, and they cried, “Please
read us a fairy tale.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma laughed and sat down
and read to them. And here is the story she read:</p>

<p>There was once a little dwarf who lived all
alone in the deep woods. He was so cross that
no one would live with him. One evening as he
sat alone by his fire he heard the tinkle, tinkle,
tinkle, of sleigh bells.</p>

<p>“Santa Claus, maybe,” he said, “but what do
I know about Santa Claus? I never hung up
my stockings in all my life.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sound of sleigh
bells. Then there was a great shout, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
little dwarf went out to see what had happened.</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose had happened?</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus10.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>Brushed Santa Claus all over</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Santa Claus had driven into a snowdrift and
he could not get out. His sleigh had tipped over
and his toys had spilled upon the snow.</p>

<p>Santa Claus was half buried in the snow when
the little dwarf ran out and cried, “Hello, old
Santa Claus! Can’t you get out?”</p>

<p>The little dwarf pulled and tugged at the reindeer,
and he pulled and tugged at Santa Claus.
Then he went for a snow-shovel, saying, “You
are so big I will have to dig you out!”</p>

<p>He dug Santa Claus out of the snow. Then he
and Santa picked up the toys, and put them all
safely back into the sleigh.</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf whisked into the house and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
came back with a tiny broom and brushed Santa
Claus all over, and helped him shake off the snow.</p>

<p>Poor old Santa Claus was so wet and cold he
began to sneeze, “A-kit-chew! a-kit-chew!”</p>

<p>The little dwarf stamped his foot and said,
“This will never do! Come in and get warm!
Come in and dry your whiskers!”</p>

<p>Then Santa Claus laughed until he shook all
over, but he was very glad to follow the little
dwarf into the house, though he had to stoop
to get in at the doorway. He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A bowl of soup if you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will help Santa not to freeze!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf stamped his foot again and
shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What do you suppose? What do you suppose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall I stir soup with my ugly nose?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Santa Claus laughed and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha! ha! ha! hee! hee! hee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make for me a cup of tea!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf stamped his foot again and
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What do you think? What do you think?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can an ugly dwarf make tea to drink?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the little dwarf was gone for a long time
and Santa Claus almost fell asleep. He shook
himself to keep awake.</p>

<p>He said, “I must not go to sleep to-night of
all nights in the year!”</p>

<p>Then he said, “I wish the dwarf would hurry.
I wish he would get me some tea.”</p>

<p>Then Santa Claus began to sing a little song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jolly, jolly Santa Claus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rides out across the snow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jolly, jolly Santa Claus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brings nicest toys, you know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang up your stockings large and small,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Late at evening he will call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jolly Santa Claus!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the time Santa Claus was singing, the cross
little dwarf worked away in the kitchen.</p>

<p>He rapped and he tapped and he mixed and
he stirred, and after awhile he came in and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Last call for soup in the dining car!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurry, old Santa, wherever you are!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Santa Claus went into the kitchen and there
was the nicest supper you ever saw!</p>

<p>The little dwarf yelled,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What do you think? My dishes are small,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So I gave you the bucket, the dish-pan, and all!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Santa Claus laughed until he cried, for
sure enough, there was the soup in the little
dwarf’s dish-pan, and the tea was served in a
bucket!</p>

<p>Santa Claus was so very hungry that he ate
and drank all the food that was before him.</p>

<p>Then he rolled his eyes and said in a half
whisper, “Did you ever hang up your stocking?”</p>

<p>The little dwarf stamped his foot and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What? ho! ho! I am foolish I know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I do not hang up my stocking, no! no!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“All right,” said Santa Claus, “I must be
going. If you change your mind about the stocking,
it will be all right.”</p>

<p>Then Santa Claus put on his great fur cap and
his great fur coat, and the little dwarf stood before
him and he stamped his foot and cried,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I never hung up my stocking at all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I never believed old Santa would call.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf ran out into his barn and got
a great armful of hay. It was all he could do to
carry such an armful. He fed Santa’s reindeer.</p>

<p>And Santa Claus said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I thank you kindly, have a care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You may find a stocking there!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Santa Claus gave a whistle and shout and
his reindeer bounded over the snow.</p>

<p>“I will not hang my stocking up!” roared the
little dwarf, and he stamped his foot in the snow.</p>

<p>Soon Santa Claus was out of sight. Then the
little dwarf went back into his house.</p>

<p>When he got into the house, he winked and he
blinked his eyes, and he was so surprised that he
forgot to scold, for by the fireplace hung a little
red stocking!</p>

<p>“I did not hang that up!” shouted the little
dwarf. “I did not hang that up!”</p>

<p>He took a peep into the stocking, and what do
you suppose he saw? There in the stocking was
a little gold cane, just the right size for a little
dwarf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said the dwarf, “that is a pretty nice
cane, but mind you, I did not hang that stocking
up!”</p>

<p>By and by he went into the kitchen to wash
his dishes, and imagine his surprise to see all his
dishes dry and hanging in their right places.</p>

<p>“I want my own supper!” he roared.</p>

<p>Then he lifted a plate from the shelf, and under
it he saw a new penny. Then he took a spoon
from the drawer and out rolled another penny,
so it went on, until he got down the dish-pan to
wash his dishes, and a whole bag full of pennies
rolled down and nearly choked him!</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf looked at his pennies and
he laughed until he cried.</p>

<p>“I can never count them all,” he
said. He put all the pennies in little
piles.</p>

<p>“I shall be quite rich,” he cried.
“I wish Santa Claus would call
again.”</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf went back
and looked at his gold cane. He
walked up and down the room
with his cane in his hand.</p>

</div>

<p>“I wish Santa Claus had
left another red stocking,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
said. “I would like to wear fine red stockings!”</p>

<p>Then he tripped on the edge of the rug and he
rolled the rug up and saw another red stocking
and a red cap and a pair of red mittens!</p>

<p>He was so happy he shouted with delight,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then what do you suppose that comical little
dwarf did?</p>

<p>He put on his red cap and his red stockings and
his red mittens, and he just curled up on the rug
and went to sleep!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies fell asleep long before the
end of the story was reached, but the Ink-Bottle
Mamma liked the story so well that she read it on
to the end to herself.</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma went to bed. It
was now Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Did Santa Claus remember the Ink-Bottle
Babies, and did he fill all their stockings full?</p>

<p>Well, I guess he did! and the Ink-Bottle Babies
all woke up early and cried, “Oh Ma! please
bring us our stockings,” and the Ink-Bottle Mamma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
brought in twenty-five stockings full of apples
and nuts and toys.</p>

<p>But the great joy of the day was still to
come. Molly and Polly had their beds near the
window and they cried, “Oh Ma, here comes a
farmer’s wagon!”</p>

<p>Sure enough the wagon came and stopped right
at their door. Out jumped the farmer and his
wife!</p>

<p>The twenty-five Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah!” and the farmer and his
wife called,</p>

<p>“How can we make a snow-man?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“Please show us how to make a snow-man,”
said Polly.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma shook her head. She
said, “I am too stiff and old to make a snow-man.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies all began to talk
at once and they said, “Will no one show us
how to make a snow-man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Then the Mamma said, “Hush! Listen! Stop
your noise!”</p>

<p>Then the Babies were still and they heard the
far-off tinkle of sleigh bells.</p>

<p>Molly cried, “Oh, is it the farmer again?”</p>

<p>Polly cried, “Oh, are we going to have company?”</p>

<p>Then the twenty-five little Babies were very
still. They flattened their little noses against the
windowpanes, and looked out into the great white
world.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer, nearer, came the tinkle of
sleigh bells, and very soon a cunning little sleigh
came in sight.</p>

<p>In the sleigh were seated two dwarfs. They
were as much alike as two peas.</p>

<p>They stopped right in front of the house and
got out of the sleigh.</p>

<p>They ran to the door and asked, “Can you tell
us if we are on the right road?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma bowed and said, “It
all depends on where you are going, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“It always depends on where we are going,”
snapped the first little dwarf.</p>

<p>The second little dwarf said, “We are not gentlemen
at all, we are only dwarfs!”</p>

<p>Just at that minute, the first little dwarf caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
sight of the twenty-five Babies with their noses
still flattened against the windowpanes, and he
cried, “Excuse me, but I must have one of those
Babies.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried the Ink-Bottle Mamma.
“They are not for sale. You cannot have one
of my Babies.”</p>

<p>Then she shut the door quickly and left the
two little dwarfs standing on the doorstep.</p>

<p>“I want one of the Babies!” howled the first
little dwarf.</p>

<p>The second little dwarf took him by the arm
and led him down the walk back to their little
sleigh.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they live in the deep woods,” said
Polly.</p>

<p>“I wonder where they were going,” said Molly.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma went and kissed every
one of her Babies.</p>

<p>She said, “They cannot have any of my Babies.
I cannot spare one of you!”</p>

<p>The old clock sang a new song. It sounded like
this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tick, tock, tick, tock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’re very sly, very sly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tick, tock, tick, tock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They may return by and by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>A whole row of snow-men</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma pretended that she did
not hear the clock’s song, and she said, “Hurry,
hurry into your caps and mittens and I will tell
you how to make a snow-man!”</p>

<p>Then the twenty-five Ink-Bottle Babies put on
their caps and mittens, and went out doors.</p>

<p>Mamma called to them to roll the snow over
and over. Each Baby rolled a snow-man.</p>

<p>“Put in sticks for arms,” she called. “Make
eyes, and mouth, and nose.”</p>

<p>My! what a jolly time the Ink-Bottle Babies
had!</p>

<p>They made a whole row of snow-men, and they
worked so late that the stars came out and began
to twinkle.</p>

<p>Then twenty-three of the Babies said, “We are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
cold and hungry. We are going into the house.”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly said, “Run on; we are not ready
to go in yet.”</p>

<p>So the twenty-three Babies ran in and found
Mamma making gingersnaps in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Then Molly said, “Hark! what is that?”</p>

<p>Then Polly said “Hark! I hear something.”</p>

<p>Just at that minute a tiny sleigh drew up at
the door. It was the same sleigh that had been
there before.</p>

<p>In the sleigh sat the two little dwarfs. They sat
very still. They had hidden their sleigh bells.</p>

<p>The first little dwarf jumped out of the sleigh
and whispered to Molly and Polly, “Have a sleigh
ride? We will bring you home again safe and
sound!”</p>

<p>Then Polly said, “We must ask Ma.”</p>

<p>And Molly said, “I will ask Ma.”</p>

<p>The little dwarf winked his eye and said, “I
have asked Ma already!”</p>

<p>So Molly and Polly got into the sleigh and they
bounded away, away, away over the snow.</p>

<p>Why didn’t the Ink-Bottle Mamma come out
and stop them? She was busy making gingersnaps!</p>

<p>“Are you warm enough?” asked the first little
dwarf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Then the second little dwarf began to sing in
a drowsy voice,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heigho! over the snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away in our little sleigh we go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heigho! hear the merry winds blow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away, away, away we go!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty soon Molly and Polly went to sleep.</p>

<p>When they woke up they found themselves in
the cutest little house in the world. They were
in the house of the two little dwarfs!</p>

<p>The little dwarfs capered and danced about
them and said, “You are the cutest Babies in
the world. Come and see grandpa!”</p>

<p>They went into the next room and there sat
a very old dwarf. He stared at the Babies and
said,</p>

<p>“I am two thousand years old. Pray tell, how
old are you?”</p>

<p>“Say you are two hundred,” said the first
little dwarf, stamping his foot at grandpa.</p>

<p>Grandpa shook his head and said, “I have
always been two thousand years old as long as
I can remember.”</p>

<p>He pointed his finger at Molly and Polly and
said, “Can you tell the time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>Then he took a large gold clock out of his
pocket. “I always carry a clock,” he said. “I
don’t believe in watches. They run fast or slow.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the little dwarfs, and said,
“Speaking of time, is supper ready?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies stared at the clock. They
could not tell the time.</p>

<p>They said, “We must learn to tell time; there
is so much to learn!”</p>

<p>Just then the two little dwarfs said, “Come
into the candy room,” and they all skipped into
the next room.</p>

<p>There were bookshelves of candy and sofas of
candy, and chairs of candy!</p>

<p>Molly and Polly clapped their hands with delight.</p>

<p>“Eat all you want to!” said the little dwarfs.</p>

<p>“Eat a chair!” shouted the first dwarf.</p>

<p>“Eat a table!” shouted the second dwarf.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried Molly and Polly, “we
must not eat up your furniture, but it does look
good.”</p>

<p>“Eat it all! Eat it all! We have plenty
more!” roared the dwarfs.</p>

<p>Then Molly ate a leg of a table and Polly ate
the corner of the bookcase.</p>

<p>Just at this time grandpa came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>He was leaning on a cane made of candy</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>He was hobbling along leaning on a very pretty
cane made of striped candy! He made a funny
appearance, indeed.</p>

<p>“Supper time,” he called. “Supper time, I
say.”</p>

<p>Then the two little dwarfs offered grandpa a
candy rocking-chair, and they ran and got on the
cutest little aprons you ever saw.</p>

<p>They went to the kitchen stove and began to
fry and bake and stew, and by and by they called,
“Supper is ready; soup is served.”</p>

<p>They had a nice supper and grandpa was so
hungry he ate with a fork and spoon at the same
time!</p>

<p>Molly and Polly had eaten so much candy they
could not eat any supper.</p>

<p>Grandpa said, “That is the way our visitors
always do.”</p>

<p>Then he pulled the clock out of his pocket and
said, “Tell the time, please.”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly said, “We are sorry but we
do not know how to tell the time.”</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” said grandpa. “If you want
to enjoy life, you must learn to tell the time.”</p>

<p>Just then one of the little dwarfs began to pour
out a glass of milk from a very strange-looking
pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if that is the magic pitcher?” whispered
Polly.</p>

<p>Polly whispered so loud that the little dwarf
heard her.</p>

<p>He was so surprised that he dropped the pitcher
and it broke into one hundred pieces.</p>

<p>The room began to melt away and Molly and
Polly woke up and rubbed their eyes.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma was shaking them.</p>

<p>“You poor dears!” she said. “Are you almost
frozen? You have been asleep in the snow!”</p>

<p>Then she carried Molly and Polly into the house.</p>

<p>They rubbed their eyes again and cried, “Where
are the little dwarfs? Where is the old grandpa?
Where is the magic pitcher?”</p>

<p>Then all the Ink-Bottle Babies set up a shout,
“You have been asleep! You fell asleep playing
in the snow!”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly could not believe they had been
dreaming. They said, “We went riding in a
sleigh!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma put dry clothes on
them and said, “Sit and toast yourselves by the
fire, while I get you some gingersnaps!”</p>

<p>When Molly and Polly were warm again, they
told their wonderful dream.</p>

<p>When they had finished talking the Ink-Bottle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Mamma said, “Can’t you
really tell the time, my
dears?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus14.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>It is nine o’clock</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies all
shook their heads. Then the
Ink-Bottle Mamma gave them
twenty-five little circles of
pasteboard, and she gave them some little pieces
for hands of each clock.</p>

<p>They fastened the hands on the clocks with
twenty-five little pins.</p>

<p>Now she said, “We will make numbers on the
clockface.”</p>

<p>So they wrote twelve at the top of the circle,
and six at the bottom; they wrote three at the
right and nine at the left; then they put the other
numbers between.</p>

<p>The Mamma said, “Put the long hand at twelve,
and the little hand at nine; now tell the time!”</p>

<p>Not one of the Ink-Bottle Babies could tell what
time it was. Could you?</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The little hand tells the hour, you know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As round and round the two hands go;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies clapped their hands
and said, “It is nine o’clock!”</p>

<p>Then they looked up at the big clock on the
mantle-piece, and just then they cried, “The big
clock is nine o’clock, too.”</p>

<p>At this very minute the big clock began to strike.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies held their breath and
counted the strokes of the clock.</p>

<p>They counted the strokes on their fingers!</p>

<p>Sure enough, the big clock struck nine.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the Babies. “We are learning
to tell the time.”</p>

<p>Just then there was heard a gentle tap at the
door. The door opened and in walked an Ink-Bottle
Baby. She wore a red dress and a red sunbonnet.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How do you do? I am tired, too;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May I come in and sit with you?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies all shouted, “Can you
tell the time?”</p>

<p>The new Ink-Bottle Baby shook her head and
said, “I have been walking over maps all day.
The children want a red line here, and a red dot
there, and I am very tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“Did you meet the little dwarfs in the woods?”
asked Molly and Polly together.</p>

<p>“Who are the little dwarfs?” asked the new
Ink-Bottle Baby, and Molly and Polly said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“We have a picture of two little dwarfs;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Within our picture-book.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the words “magic pitcher,” the new Ink-Bottle
Baby sprang from her chair, and ran out
of the house as fast as her legs could carry her.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” asked the
Ink-Bottle Mamma.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies clapped their hands and
danced up and down.</p>

<p>They shouted, “There really must be a magic
pitcher! There truly must be a magic pitcher!”</p>

<p>Then they looked out of the window and saw
the snow-men they had made. The snow-men
looked very real in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Listen! the snow-men
are singing.”</p>

<p>They kept very still and they heard this song:</p>

<p>One Saturday morning it began to storm and
it snowed and the wind blew harder and harder.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies said, “Oh Ma! what
shall we do?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said,
“What month is this?”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly said,
“It is February.”</p>

<p>Then the twenty-three
other Ink-Bottle Babies
set up a shout. They cried,
“Valentines! Valentines!”</p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Polly set up a cry</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “You have
guessed right; we are going to make valentines.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies got some tables
and scissors and paste.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma brought paper and some
pictures, and she said, “You may cut out some
hearts.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies went to work. They
got paste on the table and on their hands and
faces.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Polly set up a cry, and soon all
the Ink-Bottle Babies shouted, “Oh Ma! Polly
has cut her finger! Oh Ma! Come quickly!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, Polly had cut her finger.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma came and tied it up
and said, “Every one of you wash your hands.
I can’t have all my Babies cut their fingers!”</p>

<p>So the Ink-Bottle Babies got out twenty-five
little basins and filled them with water, and they
washed their hands.</p>

<p>Then they said, “Read us a fine fairy tale, Ma,
please do.”</p>

<p>So Mamma got out the fairy tale book and
read this story of The Magic Spoon:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a merry little dwarf.
He sang all day,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">But happy is he with his magic spoon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the little dwarf sat down by the table.
He had a great yellow bowl, and a silver spoon
in front of him.</p>

<p>He stirred some flour around in the bowl, and
what do you suppose he took out of the bowl?
He took out a beautiful gold necklace!</p>

<p>Then he stirred again, and he took out a blue
necklace; then he stirred again, and he took out
a red one.</p>

<p>All the time as he worked he sang over and
over,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who is so merry, heigho! heigho!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But happy is he with his magic spoon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last the spoon got tired working and it said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little dwarf, upon my word,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What would you do if that song were heard?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>The little dwarf was so surprised to hear the
spoon speak that he stopped stirring the flour
in the bowl, and just at that very minute there
was heard a rap at the door.</p>

<p>The little dwarf hid the spoon and went to the
door. There stood a very ugly old dwarf. His
name was Cross-Patch. All the dwarfs in the
wood were afraid of him.</p>

<p>He stamped his foot now and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have come to get the magic spoon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Better give it to me soon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be it morning, night, or noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you give up the magic spoon?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the first little dwarf shook his head and
cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I do not give my spoon away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’d better call another day!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cross-Patch said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will call to-morrow noon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then perhaps I’ll get the spoon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He went off muttering to himself, and shaking
his cross old head as he went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Now the little dwarf was not at all afraid.
He said, “I will hide my spoon in a safe place.”</p>

<p>Then he put on the red necklace and the blue
necklace and the gold necklace, and he said,
“When I meet the Fairy Queen I will give her
a new necklace every day.”</p>

<p>Just then the little dwarf heard a great flapping
of wings. He looked out and he saw one hundred
crows.</p>

<p>Old Cross-Patch had sent the crows to eat up
the little dwarf’s corn!</p>

<p>The crows ate all night, and till noon the next
day.</p>

<p>Then they flapped their wings and went away,
and old Cross-Patch came and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have come to-day at noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you give up the magic spoon?”</div>

<p>The little dwarf was angry, you may be sure.
He shook his head and cried,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I will not give my spoon away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You need not call another day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then old Cross-Patch shook his fist at the little
dwarf and ran down the road. “I have spoiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
your corn,” he called back, but this time the
little dwarf did not answer him.</p>

<p>The next night there was a great noise, and
five and twenty little dwarfs came and blew so
much soot down the chimney that everything in
the little dwarf’s house was ruined.</p>

<p>I should say everything except one was ruined.
The box in which the little dwarf kept the spoon
and necklaces was safe because it was under his
pillow.</p>

<p>The next morning old Cross-Patch came as
before and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here I am at break of day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you give your spoon away?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf was very angry and he shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will not give my spoon away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You may not have it now, I say.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Cross-Patch went away scolding and grumbling
as before. Late that night there was a great
noise, and the bricks from the chimney began to
fall. The little dwarf had just time to grab his
box and run out at the door.</p>

<p>All the bricks from the house fell one upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
another, and soon the little house was all gone;
only a pile of bricks remained!</p>

<p>Old Cross-Patch came again and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you won’t give the spoon away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll turn your pretty hair all gray!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf had lovely golden curls. Now
the spoon was so angry at Cross-Patch that he
could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>He turned very red in the face and began to
kick and roll over.</p>

<p>He sprang out of the box, and jumped right
at old Cross-Patch and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be it morning, night, or noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come and take the magic spoon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the spoon boxed Cross-Patch on the right
ear and on the left ear.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh! please stop!” called Cross-Patch.</p>

<p>The little dwarf was so tickled he stood by and
clapped his hands.</p>

<p>Then the spoon turned to old Cross-Patch and
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You shall build the house again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll work in sunshine and in rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp70" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus16.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>Boxed Cross-Patch on the right ear</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then old Cross-Patch saw there was no way
out of it, so he had to go and pile one brick on
another, and if he did not work fast enough the
spoon would slap him on the back.</p>

<p>The five and twenty dwarfs who had sent soot
down the chimney came, and they were sorry for
Cross-Patch, and went to work to help him
rebuild the house.</p>

<p>The spoon danced about and rapped them all
sharply every once in a while.</p>

<p>When the house was all done the spoon cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now, old Cross-Patch, step inside;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clean the rug and fireside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>The spoon made Cross-Patch clean everything
in the house. Then the spoon cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cross-Patch, take your little men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plant the corn in rows again!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Cross-Patch and the little dwarfs worked
all night. They planted corn in the little garden.
The spoon got so angry it beat them all until they
were black and blue; then finally it chased old
Cross-Patch away, and away, and away, out into
the Land of Nowhere.</p>

<p>The five and twenty little men saw that the
corn they had planted was already beginning to
grow, so they laid down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the spoon came back.</p>

<p>There high in the tree sat the little dwarf; beside
him sat the Fairy Queen.</p>

<p>The Queen said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I try the necklaces, one, two, three,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But none is good enough for me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the little dwarf helped the Fairy Queen
down from the tree and they went into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp58" style="max-width: 34.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus17.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>I try the necklaces, one, two, three</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>The spoon went in, too, and it began to stir
at a terrible rate, all by itself in a great big bowl,
and pretty soon there came out of the bowl the
finest gold necklace in the land.</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen clapped her hands and cried
to the dwarf and the spoon, “You will always
be welcome in my palace.”</p>

<p>Then the dwarf clasped the necklace around
her neck, and she was gone.</p>

<p>The spoon stood up very straight and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whatever song you wish to sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remember, ’tis the safest thing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To put the spoon upon the shelf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keep the secret to yourself!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the spoon jumped up into the box on
the shelf. The five and twenty little dwarfs woke
up and tapped politely at the door, and asked for
breakfast, but the spoon called out from its hiding
place,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you do not go away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll box your ears again to-day!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the five and twenty little dwarfs ran away
as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>The little dwarf forgot what the spoon had said
and he went about his work singing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who is so merry, heigho! heigho!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a dwarf who lives in the woods, heigho?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He may dance away by the light of the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But happy is he with his magic spoon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now the magic spoon was so upset to think the
little dwarf could not keep still that he sprang
down from the shelf and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You will not heed whate’er I say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, little dwarf, you’ll go away!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he beat the little dwarf all the way to the
palace of the Fairy Queen, where he became a
servant and he never dared to return to his home.</p>

<p>The magic spoon went back to his place on the
shelf.</p>

<p>For all I know he may be there yet!</p>

<p>“Didn’t any one ever see the magic spoon
after that?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“Is it a really, truly, true story?” asked
Molly.</p>

<p>Then the other Babies laughed so hard that they
rolled over and over on the floor, and at last they
said, “Some day we will go in search of the magic
spoon and the magic pitcher. May we go, Ma?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma laughed and said, “It
is time for you funny little Babies to go to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma read so slowly it had
taken her all day to read the story.</p>

<p>The Babies went off happily to bed singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, the magic pitcher and magic spoon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will try to find them soon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By and by to the woods we’ll go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And meet the dwarf with his merry heigho!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then some one tapped on the door. It
was the Ink-Bottle Papa. He had been away for
his health for a year and a day!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma was glad to see him
again, you may be sure.</p>

<p>She said, “Hush, my dear, we may wake the
Babies.” But she was not quick enough, for all
the Babies woke up and began to come downstairs
by twos and threes to see who had come to their
house.</p>

<p>They hugged their dear Papa until he cried
out, “Look in my pockets and see a surprise!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies looked in his pockets
and drew out twenty-five little silver spoons.</p>

<p>They all looked exactly alike, and the Babies
cried, “Thank you, Papa, we will call them our
magic spoons.”</p>

<p>Then the Babies went to bed again.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>One day in the merry month of March, the Ink-Bottle
Papa said, “I have a half-holiday. What
shall we do?”</p>

<p>Then the twenty-five little Ink-Bottle Babies
clapped their hands and cried, “Hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Shall we do the family washing?” asked the
Ink-Bottle Papa with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are so little, it is true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The washing is very hard to do!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Papa laughed and he said,
“Then shall we sweep the house all over, from
top to bottom?”</p>

<p>Then the Babies said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The brooms are heavy for us to hold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And after all we are not very old!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Papa clapped his hands
and said, “Shall we mow our lawn, front and
back?”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are very little to mow to-day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us help keep your holiday!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Papa stopped fooling, and
he said, “There is a fine wind for flying kites;
we will all make kites to-day; then we will go out
and fly them.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” cried the Babies. “We
will all make kites. We will make big kites,
little kites, and middle-sized kites!”</p>

<p>Now, did the Ink-Bottle Babies make kites?
Well, I guess they did!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Oh, oh, oh, my kite pulls so hard!</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>They cut and they pasted, and they rapped and
tapped away, and then they said,</p>

<p>“Our kites are finished. May we go and fly
them, Pa?”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Papa said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One, two, three, away we go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">March like soldiers in a row!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies got into two rows
and they followed the Ink-Bottle Papa over to the
meadow.</p>

<p>Then they began to run and fly their kites.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh,” cried Polly, “my kite pulls so
hard!”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh,” cried Molly, “I am afraid my
kite will get away.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Papa said, “It is the merry
March wind pulling at the kites!”</p>

<p>Then they laughed and danced and played in
the sunshine, and by and by Papa said, “Come,
sit down and rest and I will tell you a story.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies all sat down. They still
held on to the strings of their kites.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Papa began his story of The
Magic Kite:</p>

<p>Once upon a time a little boy made a kite. He
made the kite of paper and string.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Then the little boy was very happy, and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Blow, merry wind, blow; my kite and I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along with the breezes will fly, and fly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then a voice said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Perhaps you can fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you only try!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little boy looked around, and there sat the
funniest little dwarf. The dwarf sat cross-legged
on an old tree-stump.</p>

<p>“Ever think much about flying?” he said, and
he screwed his face up into a thousand wrinkles.</p>

<p>The little boy shook his head.</p>

<p>Then the dwarf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flying might be easy for you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The butterflies try it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The birds try it, too;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, it might be easy for you!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little boy said, “I would like to fly; tell
me truly how to do it.”</p>

<p>The little dwarf said, “Just lend me your kite.”</p>

<p>Then the dwarf took the little boy’s kite and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
he blew on it until it became bigger and stronger
and it was indeed very hard to hold.</p>

<p>The little dwarf then took hold of the string
and the kite pulled harder and harder and harder,
and soon it lifted the little dwarf off of his
feet. He did not let go of the string.</p>

<p>The little dwarf went up, up, up among the
clouds. Soon the little boy could see only a speck
among the clouds. He was beginning to be sorry
he had loaned the dwarf his kite, for he was
afraid he would never see it again.</p>

<p>Then he heard a whistle and a voice called out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sailing high up over the town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here I come again, down, down, down.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, down came the little dwarf, holding
to the kite.</p>

<p>“Want to fly now?” he asked. “It is lots of
fun.”</p>

<p>The little boy lost no time, you may be sure,
in taking hold of the kite string. He took hold
of the string and the kite began to pull.</p>

<p>“Hold on tight!” shouted the little dwarf.
“Hold on tight!”</p>

<p>Then the little boy went up, up, up, over the
tree-tops, and over the houses until he came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
the stars! My, but he was away up high in the sky!</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus19.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>The little boy went up, up, up, until he came to the stars</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The stars were so bright he winked and blinked
his eyes, and suddenly he forgot to keep hold
of the string, and down, down, down he fell to
earth again, and his kite flew away and he never
saw it again!</p>

<p>“Did the fall hurt him?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“Did he truly lose his kite forever?” asked
Polly.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Papa said, “The boy was not
hurt at all, for he fell on his mother’s feather bed
that she had out on the porch airing!”</p>

<p>“Oh my!” cried all the Babies at once. “What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
fun it would be to fall on a feather bed! We
wish we could fly and fall in soft places, too!”</p>

<p>Just then Molly gave a little cry, and Polly gave
a little cry.</p>

<p>What do you suppose was happening?</p>

<p>They felt their kites pulling so hard that they
began to go up, up, up. Before the Ink-Bottle
Papa could stop them they had sailed out of sight!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies said to the Papa, “We
will go home and ask Mamma what to do. She
always tells us what to do!”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly went up, and up, and up, and
then just as suddenly they began to go down, and
down, and down.</p>

<p>They said, “We wonder if we will come down
on a feather bed?”</p>

<p>Did they come down on a feather bed? Oh no,
they came down to a hole in the ground, and they
went down in the hole, down, down, and they still
held their kite strings, and they cried, “What a
jolly ride, up and down, up and down.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to a stop and landed
right in a strawberry-bed.</p>

<p>They were so pleased to see the strawberries,
that they forgot about their kites for the first
time and let go of the strings. They began to
pick berries and eat them as fast as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Led them into a room full of toys</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>While they were eating away a little old woman
came in and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fi-go-fee, what do I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Children as sure as sure can be!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Molly and Polly stopped eating and made
a bow and said,</p>

<p>“We hope it does not annoy you to have us
eat strawberries. You have so many of them, and
we rode here all the way with our kites!”</p>

<p>Then the little old woman looked out of the
window and saw the kites floating away.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come with me, come with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many curious sights you’ll see!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she took Molly and Polly by the hand and
led them into a room full of toys.</p>

<p>The little old woman cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See the toys, the many toys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost by careless girls and boys!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Molly said, “May I get on the rocking-horse?”
And Polly said, “May I ride in that funny little
carriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>The little old woman said in an old squeaky voice,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No time to play, no time to play;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call again another day!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she showed them a room full of caps and
coats and all kinds of clothing, and she said with
a wave of her hand, “Careless children lost them
all! Come now, help me count and sort out the
clothes.”</p>

<p>Then Molly and Polly went to work to sort
the caps. There were red caps, and blue caps, and
yellow caps, and all kinds of caps. Then they
went to work and sorted the neckties, and they
worked all day, and still there were more caps
and more neckties than you ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>The room they were in led into a hall and the
hall, too, was full of lost things.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly and Polly wanted to go home.
They stopped work and said, “We want to go
home right away!”</p>

<p>The little old woman clapped her hands and said,</p>

</div>

<p>Then the little old woman went down the hall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and locked the door and left Molly and Polly
alone.</p>

<p>“How shall we ever get home?” they said.</p>

<p>Then they heard a voice say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through the tree-trunk, come with me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only find the magic key!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They looked around, and sure enough, right in
the middle of the room was a tree-trunk! Its
roots came down to the floor. In the lower part
of the tree-trunk there was a door and the door
was locked.</p>

<p>“Where shall we look for the magic key?”
asked Molly and Polly. And the tree fairy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The magic key will open the door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It never has been found before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Molly and Polly looked all over the room,
you may be sure.</p>

<p>They looked under the piles of clothing and
they looked under the furniture. Just then a
canary began to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Give me, please, some food and drink;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can help you then to think!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>Now Molly saw a little pitcher of water on the
window sill, and Polly saw a little package of
birdseed on a chair; so they gave the canary some
food and drink.</p>

<p>As they peeped into the bird-cage, they saw on
the floor of the cage a tiny key! The key was
tied with blue ribbon. “Oh, the key! the key!”
they cried, but the Tree Fairy said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Softly, softly, for you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You must gently turn the key!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Molly and Polly went to the tree-trunk on
tiptoe, and they put the key in the lock. Click!
went the lock, and the door opened.</p>

<p>There stood the Tree Fairy all dressed in red
and yellow!</p>

<p>The Tree Fairy was so little he could sit in
Polly’s hand.</p>

<p>The Fairy called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is room, the tree is wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quickly, quickly jump inside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it was well that Molly and Polly lost no
time, for just as they had gotten inside the tree
the little old woman came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Up, up, up the tree they went. The Fairy
held the key.</p>

<p>“I will let you out by and by, if you grant me
a wish,” said the Fairy.</p>

<p>“What is your wish?” asked Molly and Polly,
and the Fairy said, “Two white sheets, nice and
neat. Then I’ll use the key and set you free!”</p>

<p>Molly and Polly laughed and each one of them
took out a neatly folded pocket-handkerchief, and
they presented them to the Fairy!</p>

<p>The handkerchiefs were just the right size for
fairy sheets and the Fairy was delighted.</p>

<p>He put the key in the lock; click, click, the door
opened, and out stepped the Ink-Bottle Babies in
their own park at home.</p>

<p>They were in such a hurry to get home they
forgot to say, “Thank you,” and they did not
even stop to see which tree they had stepped out
of. They have been looking for the tree ever
since.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies were so pleased to see
Molly and Polly, that they hugged them nearly to
death.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Mamma and Papa said, “No
more magic kites for our family.”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma gave them each a
cup of hot chocolate and put them to bed.</p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>The little dwarf called ‘Halt!’</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>How funny they looked going along the street
with their twenty-five little umbrellas bobbing up
and down.</p>

<p>As they went along they heard a voice cry,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In and out, without a doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will keep dry if I but try!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Babies looked down and there stood a little
dwarf. He had a long white beard that came to
the ground. He bobbed in and out among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Babies and skipped first under this umbrella, and
then under that umbrella, and it kept the Babies
quite busy looking for him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to school with us?” asked
Molly.</p>

<p>“Do you know where the magic pitcher is?”
asked Polly.</p>

<p>Then the most surprising thing happened!</p>

<p>The little dwarf called “Halt!” and every one
of the Ink-Bottle Babies stood still in the pouring
rain.</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The magic pitcher has melted away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t tell the secret, I beg you, pray!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Molly said, “How could it melt away?”</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The magic pitcher is safe and sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps you will find it underground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Polly said, “I believe you do not know
anything about the magic pitcher; you are only
guessing!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t guessing allowed?” asked the dwarf.
Then he shouted, “Forward! march!” and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
all went on to school. When they came to school
the dwarf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I hardly dare to go inside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unless I find a place to hide!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink Bottle Babies suggested various
places for the little dwarf to hide in, but none of
the places pleased him, so he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you stay till afternoon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will come back very soon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then in a twinkling of an eye he was gone.</p>

<p>The teacher was so surprised to see all the Ink-Bottle
Babies on such a rainy day that she let
them sit wherever they pleased. They went to the
blackboard and did neat little sums, and they all
got their answers right.</p>

<p>At noon the teacher went home for dinner, and
the Babies took out their twenty-five little dinner
pails, and began to eat their lunch.</p>

<p>The rain came down harder and harder, and
the Babies said, “We wonder if the little dwarf
got drowned?”</p>

<p>Soon there was heard a rap-a-tap at the window,
and a voice called,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The rain is rather wet to-day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you open your window a little way?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies ran and opened the
window and let the little dwarf in.</p>

<p>Such a sputtering and fussing you never heard!
He shook the rain from his coat and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With no umbrella, how do you suppose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could keep dry in my little clothes?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he danced, and he hopped, and he skipped
about until he was quite dry.</p>

<p>He tasted something out of every one of the
twenty-five dinner pails.</p>

<p>Then he climbed up on the window sill and said,
“What shall we play, ‘I-Spy’?”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies said, “There really is no
place to hide. Please tell us a story instead!”</p>

<p>“Tell about the magic pitcher, or the magic
spoon,” cried Molly and Polly!</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you really, truly do not care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I prefer The Magic Rocking-Chair!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Tell us about it! Tell us about it!” cried the
Babies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>The little dwarf waited until the Babies were
still; then he began the tale of The Magic Rocking-Chair!
Here is the story he told:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who
lived with his grandparents in the woods.</p>

<p>The grandparents were so old and feeble that
the little boy had all the wood to cut and the
water to bring in. He was kept busy working
from morning till night.</p>

<p>One evening, as his grandparents fell asleep by
the fire, the little boy said, “I wish I had some
one to play with me. I do wish I could have some
fun once in a while!”</p>

<p>A little dwarf stuck his head in at the door and
said, softly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little boy, if you do not care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll give you a magic rocking-chair!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There stood the little dwarf in the doorway. He
carried a beautiful red rocking-chair. The chair
was so heavy and large for the dwarf it was all
he could possibly carry.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp81" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>Kept rocking until they arrived in China</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>He set it down in the doorway and said in a
whisper,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wherever you think you’d like to go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just sit in the chair and rock to and fro.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then in the twinkling of an eye the little dwarf
was gone. The little boy lost no time trying the
chair, you may be sure.</p>

<p>He said, “I think I would like to go to China.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
And he began to rock to and fro. He rocked so
hard that he rocked right out of the house. Then
the chair sailed away up over the tree-tops, and
he kept rocking all the way until they arrived
in China.</p>

<p>The chair stopped outside of a fine house, and
said, “I will wait for you.”</p>

<p>Then the little boy went into the house and
the Chinamen were very polite to him. They
taught him to eat with chopsticks, and they gave
him a pound of tea to take home with him. They
tied the tea up in a fine silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>A great clock struck twelve and the little boy
remembered that the chair did not want to wait
later than twelve, so he bade his new friends good-bye
and went outside.</p>

<p>He stepped into the chair and said, “Home
again, home again,” and they rode along homeward.</p>

<p>The chair said, “I know one little verse the
dwarf keeps whispering to himself when he uses
this magic chair. It is this,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘When ’tis midnight heed the hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the chair may lose its magic power.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Thank you, I will remember that,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
little boy, and whizzing along they went on home.</p>

<p>There sat the old people just as he had left them,
nid-nid-nodding by the fire.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said the chair, “I will hide outside.”</p>

<p>The little boy took his tea and his silk handkerchief
with him to his own room and he soon
fell asleep.</p>

<p>His work seemed easy to him next day. He
said, “I wonder where I shall go to-night. I believe
I will go to Holland if the chair comes
around.”</p>

<p>Next evening the old people fell asleep as before
and there was a gentle tap at the door. The
little dwarf had brought the chair again, but he
wanted a present this time.</p>

<p>He begged so hard for a present that at last
the little boy gave him the red silk handkerchief.
The little dwarf tied the handkerchief about him
as a sash and went off singing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The little boy said, “I will go to Holland.”</p>

<p>He rocked away across the sea and he had a
fine time, you may be sure.</p>

<p>The people in Holland gave him a cheese and a
pair of wooden shoes to take home.</p>

<p>At exactly twelve o’clock he stepped into the
chair and rocked home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>Night after night the little boy rode away in
the rocking-chair, and all went well until the night
he went to the circus.</p>

<p>The clown said so many funny things he forgot
about the time. It struck twelve o’clock, and one
o’clock, and then the circus was over.</p>

<p>The little boy stepped out of the tent and his
chair was nowhere to be seen, so he had to walk
all the way home.</p>

<p>The next evening the little dwarf came without
the chair. He looked very sad and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of course, little boy, you meant no harm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But you have broken the magic charm.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the dwarf explained that
the chair would rock no longer because
the little boy overstayed
his time. He said
with tears in his eyes
that the chair now would
not rock across the room.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp56" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus23.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>The clown said so many funny things</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the boy said,
“Dry your eyes, I will
tell you what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>He took the little dwarf by the hand and they
ran to the house of the crossest giant in the land.
They persuaded the giant to come and look at the
rocking-chair and mend it, for he was very clever
about such things.</p>

<p>The giant made the chair as good as new; then
he turned to the little boy and said fiercely,
“I have not had a good meal to-day. I will just
eat you up!”</p>

<p>Then the chair grew very angry. It grew so
large suddenly that the giant could sit in it, and
it said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come have a ride, and rock to and fro;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am sure I know where you want to go!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The giant forgot how hungry he was and he
sat down in the chair. The chair rocked him
down to the river and threw him in.</p>

<p>He was not drowned, of course, but he was
awfully scared, and the chair rocked back to the
little dwarf.</p>

<p>The little boy had many rides in the chair after
that, but he took the little dwarf with him, so that
they would be sure to remember the time, and not
stay out after midnight.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Is that the end?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Surely that is not the end. There must be more.”</p>

<p>The little dwarf did not want to answer, so he
said, “It is raining so hard the teacher may not
come back to school.”</p>

<p>“Please tell the end of the story,” begged the
Babies.</p>

<p>Then the little dwarf cried, “What! ho! Here
comes the farmer to take you home!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was the farmer in his big
wagon. He had come to take the Ink-Bottle
Babies home.</p>

<p>“Was that the end of the story?” called Molly
and Polly.</p>

<p>The little dwarf smiled and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you should ever want a ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come to my house and step inside!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried the Ink-Bottle Babies clapping
their hands. “Do you own the magic rocking-chair?
Will you please take us to ride?”</p>

<p>The little dwarf ran out in the rain, laughing as
he went.</p>

<p>How were the Ink-Bottle Babies to guess
whether he owned the rocking-chair or not?</p>

<p>Then they all got up and dressed in a hurry and
said, “Oh Ma! may we go to the woods? Oh Pa!
may we all go to the woods together?”</p>

<p>Then Mamma and Papa said they might all go
to the woods if they would be very careful not
to get lost.</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies each took a cute little

said, “If you please, Sir, may we gather a few

<p>Then Molly and Polly
said, “If we each give
you a cookie, would you
let us gather a few

<p>Then the little dwarf
came and peeked into
each one of the baskets
and saw, sure enough,
that each Baby had a
cookie in the basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies all put their cookies
on a large, flat stone, and the little dwarf filled
his pockets and his cap full of them.</p>

<p>Then he made a bow and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Then whisk, bound, the little dwarf was gone!</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies lost no time in picking
flowers, you may be sure.</p>

<p>They found violets, daisies, and buttercups, and
before they could believe it, it was sundown.</p>

<p>They said, “We do not care what the little
dwarf said, we will not hurry home.”</p>

<p>Then they sat down and ate the sandwiches and
apples they had brought with them.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was setting Molly cried, “Oh,
oh, oh,” and Polly cried, “Oh, oh, oh,” and all
the Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “Oh, oh, oh.” What
do you suppose was the matter? They all began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
to sink down, down, down, and it became quite
dark!</p>

<p>They sank down until they came to the top of
the magic tower, which was built under the sea!</p>

<p>They saw the fishes swim past them and they
cried, “Oh, oh, oh, where are we going?”</p>

<p>The roof of the magic tower opened and down
the Ink-Bottle Babies went to the very bottom
of the tower. They were just beginning to get
their breath when the most beautiful princess in
the world came and stood before them.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where did you come from, Babies dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how did you happen to come here?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She saw only Molly at first; then Polly and all
the rest of the Babies came tumbling down the
staircase.</p>

<p>The princess gathered up an armful of Babies
and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am so happy, the charm is broken;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I welcome the Babies now as a token.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>They had to work days and days to braid her hair</i>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>The Babies patted the princess’ dress; it was
soft and silky. Then they all begged to braid her
hair. They had to work days and days to braid
all her hair, it was so long and heavy.</p>

<p>“Tell us a story, please,” said the Babies.</p>

<p>And the princess began, “Once upon a time I
went into the woods to gather flowers!”</p>

<p>“Just like we did,” shouted all the Ink-Bottle
Babies together.</p>

<p>“I was going along humming a little tune, when
I saw a fierce little dwarf,” continued the princess.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh,” cried the Babies, “we met him,
too! We met him, too!”</p>

<p>“The dwarf talked in rhyme,” said the princess.
Then all the Babies nodded their heads.</p>

<p>The princess said, “The dwarf would not let
me have any flowers unless I gave him a cookie,
and when I did give him a cookie, he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Pick all the flowers you like to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But after sundown do not stay!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies set up a shout, for
those were the very words the little dwarf had
said to them.</p>

<p>The princess said, “I was so happy gathering
flowers that I forgot what the little dwarf said,
and after sundown I began to sink, down and
down, until I came to this magic tower.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The princess shook her head and said, “All the
doors and windows are fastened. Besides, we are
under the sea.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies looked out of the window,
and sure enough, fishes were swimming past.</p>

<p>Suddenly the princess said, “Hush, the little
dwarf is coming. Run Babies, and hide, every one
of you!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Click, click, went the key in the door, and the
door opened and the little dwarf came in stamping
and scolding.</p>

<p>He came into the room where the princess was,
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Silver and gold have I none;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How many skeins have you spun?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The princess went to her spinning wheel, and
showed the dwarf that she had spun two skeins
of thread.</p>

<p>The little dwarf stamped his foot and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If out of the tower you want to go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You will spin one hundred skeins you know!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he looked very cunning indeed, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
opened the door to his storeroom. “There are
one thousand bundles of flax,” said he. “You
must spin all of this.”</p>

<p>Then he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How soon do you really want to go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In about a hundred years or so?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The princess laughed gaily and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At sundown if you care to call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps you’ll find I’ve spun it all!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarf was so surprised at this answer
that he looked cross-eyed, but he did not
answer the princess.</p>

<p>Next he drew from his pocket a pitcher and a
spoon. Then he went and got a rocking-chair that
he had brought with him, and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll leave these treasures under the sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some day they’ll be of use to me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then whisk! bound! he was off and away and
the princess began to sing softly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies came in dancing and singing
for they had heard every word that had been
said.</p>

<p>They cried, “We are so glad Ma taught us
to spin.”</p>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies looked in the garret and
they found twenty-five little spinning wheels.
They all sat down and began to spin as hard as
they could.</p>

<p>Suddenly Molly stopped spinning and Polly
stopped spinning and then all the Babies stopped
spinning, and they ran to the place where the chair
and spoon and pitcher were.</p>

<p>They cried out, “Oh, the magic chair and spoon
and pitcher!”</p>

<p>Then the magic chair said, “All jump in and
have a ride.”</p>

<p>And the magic spoon said, “I will show you
how to spin.”</p>

<p>Then the magic pitcher said, “I will give you
a drink of cider.”</p>

<p>They all made merry, you may believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Found the princess sitting alone by her spinning wheel</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>In a short time the magic spoon had all the
flax spun into thread; then they grew tired and
sleepy and went to bed. The next day they had
no work to do as the spinning was all done, so
they looked all over the tower and peeped into
every closet and corner.</p>

<p>At last it was sundown and the little dwarf came
as before and found the princess sitting alone by
her spinning wheel.</p>

<p>He winked his eye and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Did you spin all the flax I gave you yesterday?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are you sure you’re quite ready to go away?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the princess showed him all the thread, and
the dwarf was so surprised that he hardly knew
what to say. He began to gather up the thread to
take away with him, and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may laugh and shout, you can’t get out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You have had help beyond a doubt!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the magic spoon came in and beat him,
and the magic pitcher stood in front of him and
poured water on him. Then the magic chair came
up behind him and he fell right into it. The chair
rocked him out of the window into the deep sea,
and he never troubled the princess any more.</p>

<p>Then the chair came back and said, “Get in,
every one of you, and I will give you a ride.”</p>

<p>Then they all got in, the magic pitcher and spoon,
too, and they rode away, away, away, to the palace
where the princess lived. They let the princess out;
and then they rode to the home of the Ink-Bottle
Babies, and let all the Babies out. The magic chair
then rocked away, taking the magic spoon and
pitcher with it.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the Ink-Bottle Babies, “hurrah!
hurrah! it is glad vacation time!”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Mamma said, “We will all
go to the woods to-day.”</p>

<p>So the Babies were busy packing their twenty-five
little dinner pails and they packed a basket
of lunch for Ma and Pa.</p>

<p>They all started merrily toward the woods.
Molly said, “Do you suppose we will find the
house where the little dwarfs live?”</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies all clapped their
hands and shouted, “Oh Ma! oh Pa! do help us
find the little dwarfs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>Then Mamma took out a red and white table
cloth and spread it on the grass, and all the Ink-Bottle
Babies began to unpack their dinner pails,
and soon they had a fine dinner ready.</p>

<p>They filled their glasses with water from a
spring, and just as they were going to sit down
a little dwarf ran past them and called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When you take your meal at noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You should use the magic spoon!”</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>They filled their glasses with water from a spring</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the little dwarf
took the magic spoon
and dipped it into every
glass of water, and
the water turned
at once into lemonade.</p>

<p>They looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
around to thank the little dwarf, but he was gone!</p>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies cried, “We must
find the house where the little dwarfs live!”</p>

<p>After a while the Ink-Bottle Mamma and Papa
got tired and went home. They left the Babies in
the woods for a while.</p>

<p>The Babies were so sleepy they took quite a
nap, and when they woke up they said, “Let us
look for the home of the little dwarfs.” They
spoke in whispers; they were almost afraid to
speak out loud.</p>

<p>They picked up their dinner pails and walked
a long way. Suddenly they saw a light twinkling
in the distance. The light came from a little wee
house in the woods. One of the Babies rapped at
the door and a little dwarf came out and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We have bedrooms five and twenty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And of food we have a plenty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kindly step in, please, to-night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By this ray of candlelight!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ink-Bottle Babies stepped inside, and they
saw five and twenty little dwarfs sitting at a
table, eating soup with their five and twenty little
spoons. The little dwarfs got up politely and
offered their seats to the Babies and they sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ink-Bottle Babies, ’tis very fine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the magic pitcher at last to dine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies started to eat some
soup, but one little dwarf ran around and poured
something into each soup dish out of the magic
pitcher. One plate of soup was changed to jelly
and one plate was changed to ice cream and so
it went all round the table!</p>

<p>The Babies shouted, “Hurrah! for the magic
pitcher,” and they laughed until they cried!</p>

<p>Then they all sat down in a circle and they
told stories and one little dwarf cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am so hungry to-night, ho! ho!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where did the magic spoon chance to go?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little dwarfs all shook their heads sadly.
Then what do you suppose happened? The Ink-Bottle
Babies all rose and began to dance and
cry,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We know who has the magic spoon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little dwarf we met this noon!”</div>

  <p class="caption">“<i>Whirling a great spoon</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then all the dwarfs put on their fuzzy coats
and their fuzzy caps, and they said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Follow the leader, every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Follow along till rise of sun!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the dwarfs went out of the door, two and
two, and the Ink-Bottle Babies did not know
what else to do, so they followed them.</p>

<p>They ran along up hill and down dale until
they came to a valley.</p>

<p>Then their leader called, “Hark! Listen! Hark!”
They looked down in a valley and they saw a
little dwarf, dancing and singing.</p>

<p>The little dwarf was whirling a great spoon in
the air. He sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be it morning, night or noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No one knows I’ve the magic spoon!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Then the little dwarfs rushed at him from one
side, and the Babies rushed at him from the other
side, and the magic spoon began to beat everybody,
and at last they all ran back to the home of
the little dwarfs. Where the magic spoon went
nobody knew.</p>

<p>Then the five and twenty little dwarfs cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We will not cry, we will not sigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The magic spoon will soon pass by!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty soon the magic spoon came dancing along
and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will go and hide upon your shelf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you’ll let me go and help myself!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dwarfs replied,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh magic spoon, ’tis very clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To every one, you’re welcome here.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The magic spoon was so pleased then that it
began to stir the river that flowed by the little
dwarfs’ home, and the river became solid gold!</p>

<p>The little dwarfs sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha! ha! ha! when we are old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We shall never want for gold!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Then they ran and got five and twenty little
bags, and they began to break up the gold in the
river and fill their bags. Still there was more gold
than the little dwarfs could carry away.</p>

<p>At last the little dwarfs were done working and
the Ink-Bottle Babies were tired and sleepy and
they said, “Tell us a story, please.”</p>

<p>Then one little dwarf told this story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little dwarf who
had a rocking-chair.</p>

<p>The rocking-chair was a pretty one; it had
golden rockers and golden arms. It was a very
comfortable rocking-chair! One day a dwarf got
into the chair. He was a very naughty dwarf. He
would not say, “Thank you,” and “If you please.”</p>

<p>Now, the chair took him for a ride and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say ‘thank you for this ride,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or you will have to stay inside!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The naughty dwarf shook his head and cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’ll not teach me manners, I do declare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You funny little rocking-chair!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp95" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus29.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“<i>Splash! the chair went right into the water</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The chair said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You may laugh and cry and even shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without ‘Thank you, Sir!’ you don’t get out!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the dwarf began to laugh and cry and
shout, for he was stuck fast in the rocking-chair,
and he could not get out!</p>

<p>Now the chair was in earnest and it rocked
as fast as it could down to a river and the dwarf
cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What are you about? What are you about?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If we rock in there, we will never get out!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Splash! the chair went right into the water. It
came up by and by and the little dwarf shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thank you, thank you, please take me out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thank you, thank you, I’ll laugh and shout!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Then the chair took the dwarf out and set him
on dry land.</p>

<p>Now as soon as the dwarf was free he would
not say “Thank you,” again, and the chair said,
“I will teach him a lesson this time.”</p>

<p>So the chair asked the little dwarf to take
another ride, and he rocked him away, away,
away up north to the land where the polar bear
lives. Then he rocked him right into a snowdrift.
The little dwarf nearly froze his toes and fingers,
and the chair said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll leave you in this drift of snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For far away I soon will go!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dwarf was so scared at the idea of being
left alone in the snowdrift that he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll say to you on bended knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thank you, sir, and if you please.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the chair rocked the little dwarf safely
home, and ever after he was so polite that if he
even met a squirrel in the woods he would stop
and say, “Excuse me, sir, am I disturbing you?
Thank you, sir, I will come this way again, if
you please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>This was the end of the story and the Ink-Bottle
Babies set up a shout as usual.</p>

<p>“What became of the magic rocking-chair?”
they all shouted together.</p>

<p>Then they clapped their hands softly, for they
saw something rocking toward them!</p>

<p>What do you suppose it was?</p>

<p>It was the magic rocking-chair!</p>

<p>Then the dwarf who had told the story said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell the chair where you want to go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ride away, ride away, singing ho! ho!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Ink-Bottle Babies all climbed into the
rocking-chair, and they shouted as they waved
their twenty-five little pocket handkerchiefs,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>Train a child’s imagination by feeding it with the fancies of
great story-tellers, is a truism familiar to all teachers. There
is nothing like the old fairy tales for nourishing young imaginations.
This group of tales Mrs. Cowles has gathered from
many sources and retold in charming fashion. That they have
gained, rather than lost, by the retelling, will soon become apparent
to teachers; for only the simplest words and phrases are
used, and the narrative is so handled as to emphasize the homely
lesson in manners or morals concealed in the story.</p>

<p>These tales are full of action and delicious nonsense which
accord with the child’s mode of living and thinking. Besides
teaching the children to read, and furnishing them with much
fine entertainment, these stories inculcate lessons in good-fellowship,
usefulness, politeness, and agreeable
wholesome living.</p>

<p>The volume comprises fifteen stories, five of
which are dramatized for schoolroom use.</p>

<p class="caption">“<i>I wonder which goose gave it to me</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother Goose,” they all cried, “your
goose has laid a golden egg!”</p>

<p>“Why, sure enough,” said Mother Goose.
“That must be my Easter present. I wonder
which goose gave it to me!”</p>

<p>Then Simple Simon waved his hand just
as though he were in school, and said, “It
was Jack-A-Dandy. I saw him put it in the
nest!”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Specimen Page</i></p>

</div>

<p>Many a young reader longs to know more
about his favorite characters in Mother
Goose—more than the short rhyme about each
is able to tell him. In this collection of miniature
stories, he has his wish gratified. Here
he gets intimate glimpses of the home and
community life of many old friends: Mistress
Mary, Boy Blue, Peter Piper, Curly Locks,
Crosspatch, Simple Simon, Jack and Jill, Tommy
Tinker, Bobby Shaftoe, and a host of
others.</p>

<p>It appears that the Mother Goose children
are a healthy, fun-loving, workaday lot of
youngsters, exactly like the boys and girls who
read about them. They attend Dame Trot’s
school. They give tea parties and Valentine
parties. They take care of the babies of the
Old Woman Who Lives in a Shoe. They help
the Crooked Man build himself a new chimney.
Dr. Foster takes them walking in the
woods and teaches them things about insects
and spiders which every child is simply aching
to know. Mother Goose herself presides delightfully
over their revels.</p>

<p>Teachers will find these stories valuable for inculcating a love of reading in
the child; first, because they are intrinsically fascinating, and second, because
they quicken his mental powers by a shrewd application of some lesson in
daily living.</p>

LAURA ROUNTREE SMITH</p>

<p class="center">Illustrated by Fred Stearns</p>

<p>“Please tell us a laughing story,” pleaded a group of
tenement children at the Settlement story hour.</p>

<p>All children laugh when they read “The Circus Cotton-Tails”
and how the merry little bunnies diligently practice their
circus tricks while mischievous Bushy-Tail plays his tricks—whirling
them off the merry-go-round, and stealing Susan
Cotton-Tail’s cookies. How the cookies become alive and
punish Bushy-Tail satisfies the little folk’s sense of justice.
And they delight in the description of the big circus parade,
and in the colored frontispiece and end sheets, to say nothing
of the many fascinating black and white illustrations.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
